Explanation:
a/ This program open a file to write content from the getchar() function, which use keyboard as its input.
b/ 
_ When you press Ctrl + D, the EOF character is pressed so the while loop condition is satisfy and do the fputc() function. 
The program wait for EOF before writing to the file because by default, all open file stream is fully buffered.
_ When you press Ctrl + C, it terminates the process during the while loop and EOF is not reached.
c/
_ So when you press Ctrl + C, the EOF never reach the loop, the buffer isnt written to the file and it is gone because no fputc() function to do it.
